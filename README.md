<strong>Integers Mod n               Z<sub>n</sub>     and   Z<sub>p</sub> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<ol>

 <li>in <strong>Z<sub>11</sub> </strong>which numbers have square roots?  What are they?</li>

 <li>In <strong><em>Z</em></strong><sub>p</sub>   show that   <strong>x<sup>2</sup>  ≡  (p – x)<sup>2</sup>  mod p.</strong></li>

</ol>

How does this help with square roots?

Give two examples to illustrate.

<ol start="3">

 <li>Solve <strong>17x  =  5  mod 29</strong>.   Show all steps.   (by hand)</li>

 <li>If we have <strong>ax  ≡ ay  mod n</strong>   can we always cancel the  <strong>a</strong> out ?  What do you think?</li>

 <li>Simplify <strong>889345234 mod 25</strong>  without  doing out the long division.</li>

 <li>Predict with algebra which members of <strong>Z<sub>15</sub></strong> will have multiplicative inverse.</li>

 <li>Solve <strong>x<sup>2</sup>  -2x  + 2 = 0  mod 13.</strong>   Show all steps.  Check your answers.</li>

 <li>Suppose for sake of discussion we are in <strong><em>Z</em></strong><sub>13</sub>. Show that <strong>a = 2</strong>  is a <strong><em>generator</em></strong> for <strong><em>Z</em></strong><sub>13</sub> in the sense that: every member of <strong><em>Z</em></strong><sub>13</sub>  is a power of 2  (except 0 , of course).  For example  <strong>9 ≡ 2<sup>8 </sup>mod 13  (</strong>kinda wrecks your notion of even numbers, doesn’t it?) What happens if you try to use <strong>a = 5</strong> as a generator?</li>

</ol>

Can you find another generator for <strong><em>Z</em></strong><sub>13</sub>  ?

<ol start="9">

 <li>A <strong>bank routing number</strong> appears in the lower left of all of your checks. Its purpose is to see the check is routed to the correct bank. It is  9 digits.</li>

</ol>

To increase the chances of detecting an error, the numbers as a group must satisfy an algebraic criteria using mod 10 arithmetic.  Specifically   if  <strong>ABCDEFGHI</strong>   is the routing number then

<strong>7A + 3B + 9C +7D + 3E + 9F + 7G + 3H + 9 I  mod 10</strong>  must be congruent to  <strong>0</strong>

<ol>

 <li>show that <strong>211872946 </strong> passes the criteria</li>

 <li>does my own check routing # of <strong>011000138</strong>  ?</li>

 <li>examine your own routing number. Just report whether it passed or not.</li>

</ol>




<ol start="10">

 <li>What does the symbol <strong>a<sup>-2</sup></strong>  in  <strong>Z<sub>n</sub> </strong> mean, in your opinion?</li>

</ol>
